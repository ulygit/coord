## Synopsis

Coord is an event invitation service that makes it easy to coordinate among your friends what the best date is for your barbecue, hiking trip or board game night!

## Code Example

Work in progress.

<!---
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In my last few weeks in NYC, we had some "going away" events that were painfully planned over Skype chat, text message and word of mouth. Finding a date that worked for everyone was always a back and forth, and people inevitably were excluded.

My hope is that Coord will make this sort of planning easier, and that more socializing and less exclusion will follow!

<!---
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Work in progress.

<!---
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
--->

## API Reference

Work in progress.

<!---
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

```bash
$ mvn clean test
```

## License

Coord is GPL v3.
